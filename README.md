# Smart-desktop-Manager
Usually user keeps lots of files oon desktop. This program aims to detect files such as pdf or text documents, workbooks, presentations,
images, music and videos etc. and move them to the default folder of respective file types.
E.g. all files with mp3 file extensions will be moved to "Music" folder which is usually already there in windows directory.
In most of windows systems, "Documents", "Pictures", "Music", "Videos" these folders are already present.
So moving desktop files to these folders will keep Desktop clean and Files sorted.
